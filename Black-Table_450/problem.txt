Good morning, and welcome to the Black Table Transit System (see message.txt). 
NO PLEASE SAVE US NOT KILL US

Hint: Black Table really likes copying its competitor, but to appease the buzzword-loving venture capitalists, 
they made it seem like there was automation involved.

(By the way, Black Table's (aka Black Mesa) competitor is Small Hole Sciences
(aka Aperture Sciences) from the Cave Johnson problems.)
