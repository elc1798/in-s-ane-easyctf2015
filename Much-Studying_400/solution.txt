There's a 700-character buffer and an int right above that.
If we overflow from the buffer, we can write to the int.
However, doing so caused a segfault before the flag read.
Playing around for a minute, I noticed that \x08 didn't cause
a segfault, but did overwrite the int. No clue why, but it works.
$ ./aplit $(python -c "print 'A'*708 + '\x08\x08\x08\x08\x08'")
