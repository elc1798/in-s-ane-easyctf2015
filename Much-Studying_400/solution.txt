There's a 700-character buffer and an int right above that.
If we overflow from the buffer, we can write to the int.

Since the code is only checking for >7, we can do something like
$ ./aplit "$(python -c 'print "A"*800')"
This will first give us the flag, then crash due to segfault.
We can avoid crashing by giving a smaller input, but why bother.

<insert flag when we get access to problem on shell>
