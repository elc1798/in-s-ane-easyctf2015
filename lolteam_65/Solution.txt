To analyze the data with wireshark, we need to convert the pcapng file to pcap format.
We can use an online tool to do so. (I used http://pcapng.com/)

Looking through the data, we can tell that there's not much to search for.
We eventually find this:
teamname=lolteam&school=lolschool&password=flag%7Bno%2C_lolteam_is_not_an_admin_account%7D&confirm=lolpasswordHTTP/1.1 200 OK

Urldecoded password:
flag{no,_lolteam_is_not_an_admin_account}
